            Hi, I&apos;m Robin, a software engineer based in Singapore&nbsp;
            ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬&nbsp; . As a full-stack JavaScript developer, my day-to-day
            revolves around React, Node.js.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I&apos;m taking on a Product Manager and Product Owner
            role in{' '}
            <a
              target="_blank"

            >
              Svested
            </a>
            , a seed-funded company that aims to make cap table and employee
            stock options management easy for founders. I (virtually) sit right
            between clients and developers, shipping features from requests and
            ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest lies in building business ideas from scratchâ€”from idea
            validation to UX/high-res prototypes, to developing the MVP with
            some branding magic sprinkled along the way. I&apos;m just highly
            facisnated by how vision morphs into reality, and am thankful to be
            able to be able to bring that to life.
